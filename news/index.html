<P><b>Aug 8:</b>
After a late decision Saturday night, by everyone involved, the entire Team 
Wildflowers decided to head over to the CJHA show so that everyone could be 
together.  It was a great experience!  Keith Meyers, towing a horse 
trailer for the first time, took <em>Miss Giggles</em>, <em>Thelwell</em>, and <em>Perpetual Bliss</em>, while 
Brooke Rossi took <em>Renie's Beau Ace</em>, and <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em> in the smaller 
trailer.  Kicking the day off, Carly Meyers took a 4th in a class of over 15 
young riders in the Mini-Stirrup Section A division aboard Wildflowers's 
Miss Giggles.  Following that, at her CJHA show debut, Hannah Young 
earned a first place (HER FIRST BLUE RIBBON!) in the Mini-Stirrup Section B 
Division.  Later Gail Strecker, aboard her gelding <em>Perpetual 
Bliss</em>, competed in the Pre-Children's Hunter and Equitation Divisions where 
she earned herself a first, a third, three fifths and a sixth!  Sarah 
Rockoff also had her CJHA debut aboard her leased gelding, <em>Renie's 
Beau Ace</em> and earned herself a second place in a gigantic class in the 
Beginner Hunter Division.  Sarah later fell off in the ring when a HUGE 
storm came in and spooked ALL of the horses outside the ring (about 30 of 
them) but we are happy to report that Sarah quickly got up and wiped the mud 
off of her face -- revealing a big smile!  She did great!!!  Kristin Bitter, 
competing in another very large class, earned four straight third places in 
the Maiden Equitation Division.  Great job Kristin!  Congratulations to all 
of our competitors and horses, Brooke and Christine were thrilled with 
everyone's performance.
</P>
<P>Special thanks also go out to the Meyers family, the Moses-Rappeport 
Family, the Bulk family, the Yound-Shea family and none other than the 
legendary groom, Ashley "Groom 'Em Till They Shine" Maelson.  Super special 
thanks also go out to Jeff for sticking out the entire day with the team!  
(We can't wait to get our hands on that new truck!)  Brooke would also like 
to take this opportunity to mention to all of our clients that she would 
like to learn to speak Italian, if anyone is available for tutoring, please 
see Brooke!<br>
GREAT JOB TEAM!!!  GO.........W-I-L-D-F-L-O-W-E-R-S!!!
</P>

<P>
<b>July 27:</b>  Rumor has it Christine passed her side saddle test, 
with a top score in her Candidate Presentation!  Congrats!!
</P>
<P>
<b>July 2:</b>
Jacks FOUND!!!  A very heart felt thank you goes out to Carolyn and Gail 
Strecker (AKA Bliss' Mom & Sister/Rider) for taking it upon themselves to 
take Miss Jingles (MJ) and Savannah home with them for the evening after they had  "mysteriously" escaped from the pen.  
Christine and Brooke spent the 
early morning hours of Tuesday driving round looking for the two Jack 
Russells and were ESTACTIC to hear from Carolyn that Savannah and MJ were safe and sound.  Brooke and Christine are forever 
indebited to them for their help.  "It is the reason why I love my job 
so much," says Christine, "I get to work with the best people that love 
their animals, my animals, and are always willing to lend a helping hand 
when we are in a pinch.  I am so thankful for Carolyn and Gail."  According 
to Miss Jingles and Savannah, the Strecker's home was very nice but they were 
not allowed to sleep in bed with them as they are normally allowed to do at 
their homes.  (Spoiled JRTs!!!)

<b>June 29:</b> Sunday found Team Wildflowers at DVHA bright and early, alone and actually a bit concerned that maybe the show had been canceled!  
But, soon more trailers started arriving, and Hannah Young and Sarah Rockoff, 
the two horses, and our trusty A number one groom, Ashley Maelson, got ready to kick rump!  
We are VERY proud to report that in a tough 
class, in the Mini-Stirrup Equitation division, Hannah Young (Kim Leach's 
student) earned a fourth and a second aboard Wildflower's <em>Thelwell</em>!  
(The second was earned on her MUCH IMPROVED figure 8!  Yeah Hannah!)  
Then, following that, Hannah entered the Mini-Stirrup Hunter class where <em>Thelwell</em> earned a third place!  
But the real excitement was yet to come....  
</P>
<P>
While Sarah was mentioning to Christine that it appeared that <em>Renie's Beau Ace</em> (AKA Ace) had 
just loosened his shoe, <em>Thelwell</em> began acting funny in the middle of the 
line up before being called to do his next figure eight.  Just then...  <emThelwell</em> decided that 
it was a little hot and sunny and the bugs were bothering him and he 
layed down and tried to roll while Hannah, the great rider that she is, quickly jumped off to safety!  
Christine, Hannah, and <em>Thelwell</em> then excused themselves from the ring.  
But, there was quite a bit of excitement over Hannah's "trick riding".  
Then, while waiting to untack <em>Thelwell</em> it became apparent that <em>Ace</em>'s shoe was a 
more than just a "little loose".  Sarah actually pulled the shoe off 
herself and then everyone headed home.  A disappointing show for Sarah as she and <em>Ace</em> 
were really ready to kick, but we are happy to report that no riders, trainers, or horses were injured, 
and Hannah pulled in more ribbons at ONLY her SECOND show EVER!!!  
And <em>Ace</em> enjoyed two great trailer rides!  
Thanks again to Ashley Maelson and Mary Shea for helping out tremenedously for the morning.  We were, in fact, home for brunch.  (A nice change from 7PM)  Next up....  DVHA jumpers!!!  GO TEAM!!!
</P>

<P>
<b>June 22:</b>
The Annual Barn Barbeque, this year a Hawaiian Luau, was a "hoot"!  Leis, 
grass skirts, hula dancing and pineapples ruled the riding ring!  We had a 
great turn-out for this ever popular event and are already planning for next 
year!  The Rock Collecting Contest was won by Drew and the combined total 
weight of the rocks collected by all entrants was over 300 pounds!  No more 
hitting those big stones in our riding lessons!  A special thank you to all 
of the parents and students who helped make the rock collecting contest such 
a success.  Brooke's limbo contest was also a big hit, with four different 
winners each recieving a gift certificate to "Lick-It" in Princeton 
Junction.  A special thank you goes to the VERY flexible, Keith Meyers for 
leading our limbo kids around and getting them under that limbo stick!
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening we celebrated Kim and Brooke's birthdays with cake and 
even sherbert.  There was a ton of great food brought to the luau; Christine 
would like to request that if you brought something to the luau,  please get her the recipe -- it would be a big help!  
(Many parents 
have been asking, who made that?  What was in it?)  Christine will hopefully 
soon have a little mini-cookbook of all of those yummy recipes for anyone 
that is interested in getting one, just ask!  The next party event is for our 
adult riders... Keep your eyes open for the Wine & Cheese Party!  Thank you 
again to everyone that made the Luau such a fun time!
</P>


<P>
<b>June 1:</b>
Dad or Man in My Life Day at Wildflowers Farm was a huge and yummy success!  
Dad's and significant others as well as a mom or two joined us for coffee, 
donuts and horse-y fun.  Thank you to everyone who joined us and had fun.
</P>
<P>
Remember, Kelley Scott and Brooke Rossi are in charge of Children's Games at 
this year's 50th June Fete to benefit the Breast Health Center at the Medical Center at Princeton (remember too that Bettie's is one of the head honchos!) We 
are still need of help for the day of the Fete in Children's Games.  nNy 
student, family member, or friend who is available to volunteer or come to 
the Fete, PLEASE come to celebrate this great cause!  Any student who is 
available but who hasn't signed up...BE PREPARED TO RIDE WITH OUT STIRRUPS 
FOR A LONG TIME!!!  Seriously, please sign up and have a great time with all 
of us!!!
</P>



<P>
<b>May 25:</b>  Wet, wet, wet -- the only word to really describe Sunday's DVHA show in Ringoes. The morning started off, well... wet! while Sarah Rockoff rode her leased horse, <em>Renie's Beau Ace</em> to win fourth in the Begnner Hunter Rider Class in a GIGANTIC class of 16 other ninnies spending Sunday in the 
pouring rain! Following this, Kelley Scott, aboard Wildflowers' <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em> earned a third in the Walk Trot Pleasure Class in another HUGE
class! Soon after Hannah Young, debuting in her first real horse show ever,
earned a fourth in the Mini-Stirrup division riding none other than
Wildflowers' <em>Thelwell</em>. After a good bit of mud built up, Jenn Carlino in her own debut show, earned 2 seconds and a fourth riding <em>Apollo</em> in the Starter Rider Division. Then it was Lena Feingold's turn to show the judge her stuff in the Short Stirrup Equitation Division, where she earned herself 1 second and 3 third places. 
</P>
<P>
After a very, very long and drenched wait, Kristin Bitter went into the Howell Medal 
Memorial Class where she earned a well deserved 3rd after having a PHENOMINAL 
round over fences and then a challenging equitation test asked for by the judge. 
Unfortunately Kristin was not able to compete in her scheduled
Pre-Children's Equitation Class (AFTER IT STOPPED RAINING!) as Mr. Apollo
had a bit of a belly ache from the foul weather. He is doing better though
and he is on a strict tummy diet. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of thank yous need to go out to the
Feingold family, the Rockoff Family, the Scott-Olivier Family, the
Young-Shea family, the Maelson family, the Carlino family, the Bitter
family, the Meyers family, Jessica Naimark, Alex Nelson and none other than
Christine's very own husband, Jeff for sticking out the day with all of us,
bearing through the weather and holding horses, making food runs, and
working their tails off. Great job again, guys!!! GO TEAM!!!
</P>

<P>
<b>May 18:</b> CJHA was another big hit for Team Wildflowers!  With an 
early start from the farm, Carly Meyers kicked off the day at East Freehold 
Park riding <em>Miss Giggles</em> in the Mini-Stirrup Section A division.  
Carly brought home her first blue ribbon and trophy from a non-Leadline class, 
as well as a 5th and a 6th in a class of over 12 riders.  This was Carly's 
first time jumping at a show and it was nothing less than shocking!  Cassidy 
Bulk continued the great fortune aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> in the Section B 
Division earning two 5th place ribbons in a HUGE class that actually had to 
be divided!  Way to go ladies (Miss Giggles included!)!!!
</P>
<P>Later, at her 2003 debut show, Gail Strecker aboard her gelding, 
<em>Perpetual Bliss</em>, tried her hand at the Pre-Children's Equitation and 
Pre-Children's Hunter divisions.  Gail brought home a ribbon from each class 
including, a first, two seconds, three thirds, a fourth and a fifth.  Way to 
go Gail - after a long winter's nap, Gail and Bliss are BACK, WATCH OUT!!!
</P>
<P>Last but not least, Krissi Ressler, aboard Wildflowers' <em>Phantom Luke</em>, 
entered the Beginner Hunter Rider and Beginner Hunter Horse divisions.  
Krissi and <em>Luke</em> brought home two seconds, two thirds, and a fifth!  Great job guys!  
Special thanks goes out to Ashley Maelson, Christina Dunne, Sue Bulk, Keith Meyers, Sarah Bulk, 
and Brooke Rossi for all of their great support, cheering and grooming.
</P>

<P><b>May 17:</b> The Children's Games crew was hard at work at the farm, painting and sprucing up things, 
getting set for the 50th June Fete.  
Thanks to Megan McGovern, Denise Nosko, and Jeanne Olivier for all their artistic talents.  If you have not signed up to help out at the Fete on June 7th, please do so, the sign-up sheet is on the corkboard.  We also have great Fete signs that are desperately seeking lawns on well-traveled streets.  If you have one of these lawns please help Bettie out!
</P>

<P><b>May 10:</b>  It is with great regret that Christine must once again deliver somber news.  After a very long evening of trying to diagnose and battle a sudden illness affecting <em>ONEOFTHOSELADIES </em> (Piggie), Christine made the very difficult decision to have <em>Piggie</em> put down.  She will be greatly missed by everyone, especially her best friend, Krissi Ressler.  Krissi and <em>Piggie</em> had been working together for over 2 years and had improved dramatically and competed successfully in Dressage.  Christine asks everyone to please keep Krissi in your thoughts and prayers.  Special thanks goes out to Kim Leach, Brooke Rossi, Dr. Daniel P. Keenan, and Krissi's friend Matt who walked, hugged and comforted <em>Piggie</em> until the end.  She is now running around and doing piaffe in greener pastures.
</P>

<P><b>May 4:</b>  Sunday morning started off a bit rough.  We regret to inform all of our friends that Rose, one of our barn kitties, was killed by a car early Sunday morning on Cranbury Road.  We will miss her greatly and thank everyone for their very sweet thoughts and prayers.
</P>
<P>
Mom/Lady in my Life Day was a big hit out at the farm.  Thank you to 
all of our clients, family, and friends for coming out and joining us.  We 
ate, we played with the horses and walked and gator'ed the property.  Dads, 
don't feel left out, your day is coming next month!!!
</P>
<P>
Congratulations go out to our instructor, Brooke Rossi, and her 5-year old 
mare, <em>Dancer</em>.  The two of them successfully competed at the Monmouth County Horse Show in the Itty Bitty division.  Brooke and <em>Dancer</em> earned themselves a 2nd and a 4th in a large class of strong competitors.  Special thanks also goes out to Sue and Cassidy Bulk, Krissi Ressler, Bettie Greber, and Christine Calandra for coming out to cheer and groom.  We'd also like to note that <em>Sunny</em> had her first trip off of the farm and SLEPT next to the ring for the day.  We got many compliments on how well-mannered and cute she was.  BUT we already knew that, didn't we?!
</P>

<P><b>Apr 27:</b>  Up with the chickens, Team Wildflowers was off to the
first DVHA Hunter Show of the Season with two trailers, 4 horses, 5 students and 2 grooms.  I believe there was also a small dog...
</P>
<P>
Sarah Rockoff and <em>Ace</em> kicked off the morning with a 5th and 6th place 
in Beginner Rider and Beginner Hunter. Great job for their FIRST SHOW 
(and for Ace, his first TRAILER RIDE AND OFF PROPERTY EXPEREINCE EVER)!
</P>
<P>
Kelley Scott and <em>Apollo</em> (AKA Sharkey), rode well in the Walk Trot division winning an 3rd place in both Equitation and Pleasure. Her third show, it appears Kelley is getting into the all important show groove that many students work very hard for many years to achieve. Congratulations!
</P>
<P>
Lena Feingold then competed on <em>Thelwell</em> in the Short Stirrup Equitation and Hunter divisions, taking home several ribbons, 
including a 1st and 2nd place. YEAH!  Kristin Bitter, also riding <em>Sharkey</em> then kicked off her series with a very impressive 2nd in the Welling C. Howell Memorial Medal Class, and followed that success with
3rd, 4th, and a 5th in Pre-Children's Equitation. 
</P>
<P>
Then for the grand finale! After a very long wait, Carolyn Hurlburt riding Bettie Greber's <em>Silver Dollar Bet</em> in his first show ever earned a 5th in the Baby Green Hunter Division. Congrats to horse and rider!
</P>
<P>
Thirteen hours and 15 total ribbons later, Team Wildflowers was back home and all tired horses were tucked in. Congratulations to all of our riders -- it is important to note that the show was packed on Sunday and all competitors were in large classes!
</P>
<P>
Special thanks to Gay Bitter, the Feingold family, Cassidy Bulk, and Hannah
Shea for all their help and support. SHowing would not be possible without
these grooms and cheerleaders! Also, a very special thank you to Bettie
Greber for driving the second trailer and helping out ALL DAY LONG! We came,
we showed, we kicked equine butt! GO TEAM!!!
</P>

Powell (at her first horse show ever!!!) riding <em>Thelwell</em> and Krissi Ressler riding <em>Luke</em>.

</P>
<P>Later in the day, Krissi Ressler earned a 3rd and a 4th in the Beginner Hunter Rider division and then followed the performance by earning 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th in the Beginner Hunter Horse section.  As a result, <em>Luke</em> was awarded his first Reserve Champion ribbon ever!

greatest horse people in the country.  They also shopped for a while and found many, many, Christmas Wish List items.  
Next year we definitely need a bigger group!!!
</P>

<P><b>Feb 10:</b> Sunday's Braiding Clinic was a big success!  
Krissi Resslar took up the reins on a moment's notice after learning the scheduled instructor, 
Carrie Sine, was ill.  Christine is very proud of Krissi's great work, and is happy to report that

We hope to see many students practicing and putting this new skill to work for the Spring shows!  Well done!

hobbles about in a walking cast.her According to Christine, "Having great people that you can call in a

A big "Thank you!" to everyone who was able to attend the 3rd annual Wildflowers Farm Holiday Party.  
We had a great attendance (108 people!) at First Wok in West Windsor.  
The food was great, the conversation was excellent and a good time was had by all.  Next up: the July Barbecue!

aboard her 4-year old Thoroughbred mare, <em>Dancer</em>, and Gail Strecker aboard her 5-year old Thoroughbred gelding, <em>Perpetual Bliss</em>, on a successful first Foxhunt outing.  Gail and Brooke were invited to go foxhunting with judge and friend, Merri Musso.  They went out on Black Friday and returned invigorated and ready for the next hunt on Friday afternoon.  We are pleased to report that both ladies had a fantastic time, were well-behaved (one must be rather proper on the hunt) and were invited to go again sometime soon!  
Now, they are trying to convince Christine to go!  
Ha ha!  Great job ladies and horses!  Tally-ho!
</P>

<P><b>Nov 14:</b> A very happy birthday to Christine!!
</P>

<P><b>Nov 12:</b> After a long trip, beginning in Oklahoma and winding through 8 states, 
Bettie's new horse <em>Silver Dollar Bet</em> arrived at the farm early Sunday morning.  
The latest addition to the Wildflowers string is a BEAUTIFUL gray 16.2h, 6-year old Trakehner Thoroughbred cross.  
He has his walk trot canter down pat and does a sweet 4-foot course.  
Silver will be used with our students of all ages, although Christine is really dying to get on him first!  
(The line to ride him forms at the rear.)  Congratulations to Bettie!
</P>
<P> Later on Sunday <em>Phantom Luke</em> (aka Lukey) took home a fifth and a sixth at the Meadow 
Show in the Beginner Hunter and Low Green Hunter classes.  
He was perfectly well mannered the entire day and with Brooke Rossi showing him off, he looked amazing.  
Congratulations to Brooke and Lukey!
</P>

<P><b>Oct 28:</b>  Congratulations to Kim Leach and his students Krissi Ressler and Eric Kodish on a tremendous showing, 
including a first in class for Kim and a sixth in Training Level for Krissi, 
at the Championships for Dressage at the Horse Park of New Jersey.  
All riders did wonderfully throughout the Dressage season -- we're so pleased with their success.
</P> 
<P> 
Congratulations also go out to Cassidy Bulk, aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> on her fourth- 
and fifth-place wins in the Mini-Stirrup Division at the Hunter Farms show.  
Cheers to Carolyn Hurlburt, riding <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em>.  
In their first show ever in the Junior Beginner Equitation Division, Carolyn earned an honorable mention in the Walk Trot class.  Both girls had very stiff competition and huge class sizes with over 15 riders in both divisions. Thank you to our grooms Sarah Rockoff, Gail Strecker, Jenn Carlino, Kelly Eiker, and Cassidy's cousin Allie on a superior job and LOUD show of support!
</P>

<b>Oct 21:</b> First things, first -- a very happy birthday to Krissi!!!
</P>
<P> Second, we are thrilled to report that Wildflowers Farm is home to the American Riding Instructors Association (ARIA) Lesson Horse of the Year!!!  Facing the usual stiff competition, <em>Gaiya</em> tied with another horse for the top honors!  Through her spokeswoman, <em>Gaiya</em> requests that the celebratory sugar cubes be sent care of the farm, 315 Cranbury Road, ....
</P>
<P>
<b>Oct 20:</b>  Congratulations to Michaela Raglione on her outstanding effort and success at DVHA in the Lead-line Division!!  With Dana LoGalbo on the one end of the leadline, and Wildflowers Farm's <em>Miss Giggles</em> on the business end, Michaela won two third-place ribbons, and a fourth, and a sixth place -- all after a lengthy delay.  Way to go!
</P>
<P> Kelley Scott, the webmaster, set down the computer keyboard long enough to put on her helmet, dress boots, and coat, and have a wonderful time in the Walk Trot Division.  With a great deal of assistance from the Farm's <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em>, Kelley won a sixth place in the Pleasure class.  Asked for comment later, she was heard to say something along the lines of "What a hoot!".
</P>
<P>Our thanks go to the support team, including groom Lena Feingold, Dana LoGalbo and Gail Strecker, and the parental units Bettie and Pat Greber, for all their help and good cheer.
</P>
<P>
<b>Oct 13:</b>  On short notice Christine learned that CJHA was cancelled today, so the trailer made a U-turn and the hunter show team headed to the Woodedge Stables.  There Gail Strecker, aboard her gelding <em>Perpetual Bliss</em> took a second, two thirds, and a fourth in their first ever "A" rated show!  Special thanks go to Carolyn Hurlburt who did an exceptional job grooming for her first time.  We are pleased to note that Gail also won CJHA year-end awards with a Grand Champion in Hunter Horse and a Reserve Champion in Hunter Rider.
</P>
<P>
Congratulations also go to Kim's students, Eric Kodish and Krissi Ressler, who both did an excellent job in their dressage show.  Eric, aboard his gelding <em>Waterford</em>, and Krissi, aboard Wildflowers Farm's <em>Oneofthoseladies</em>, earned a 62.8% and a 62.4% respectively on their Training Level tests.  Great job team, especially since it was Krissi's FIRST SHOW EVER!
</P>
<P> 
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Goodzeit family and their horse <em>Lucy</em>, who is currently undergoing treatment for a serious eye injury at the New Bolton Center.

<b>Sept 29:</b>  Yesterday Wildflowers Farm held its first ever Mini-Show and Clinic, and we owe a special thank you to Judge Merri Musso for her excellent lecture and judging.  Her fun-loving attitude, along with her phenomenal knowledge of showing and horsemanship, were incredible additions to the lessons program at Wildflowers.</P>
<P> 
Congratulations to all of our riders that showed at the clinic.  Brooke, Christine, and Kim were all proud and impressed with the effort that all put forth to do their absolute best and to help the other students in their classes!  Merri herself was very impressed with the hard work that all the riders demonstrated and was especially pleased with the degree of support, great sportsmanship, and enthusiasm the competitors and their friends and families demonstrated!  Way to go team!
</P>
<P> 
A special thank you goes out to our Registrars, Tackers, and especially the best braider in the world, Krissi Ressler.  Krissi spent hours prepping all of the horses for this Mini-Show and Clinic and Judge Musso asked to personally meet her because all of the horses were so well turned out.  Remember Krissi is available for braiding with advanced notice! 
</P>
<P>
Please remember that our next Mini-Show and Clinic will be in January with Judge and Instructor Bob Allen of Woodedge Stables.  We look forward to seeing all of our students out at that show.
</P>

<b>Sept 1:</b> The August Camp for 9- to 16-year olds was a huge success.  
The students' riding dramatically improved over the six riding lessons and their barn skills were top notched.  
They had daily seminars with Dave Witkins, the farrier, Sue Bulk, the equine massage therapist, 
and Dr. Rachael Schuster of Dr. Keenan and Associates.  Camp activities included riding, caring for the horses, 
tending to the barn, seminars, lunch and snacks.  A great time was held by all and most campers decided they would 
like to "do this EVERYDAY!"  According to Christine...  THEY'RE CRAZY! 
 We look forward to our February Camp session over the President's Day Holiday and will be taking reservations 
for camp spots on a first-come, first-serve basis.
</P>

<P>
Spots for the September 28th Clinic with Judge Merri Musso are filling up fast.  
If you are interested in this clinic please see Christine or Bettie as soon as possible.
</P>
<P> 
Please remember to sign up for the Mandatory Show Meeting on September 22nd at Brother's Pizza in Princeton Junction 
(next to the fire house).  If you have any intention of showing this fall or winter you MUST come to this meeting, 
otherwise you will have to wait until April to begin showing.
</P>
<P> 
We would like to send our very best wishes to Gail Strecker and her gelding <em>Perpetual Bliss</em>.  
They will be leaving us for the school year to attend the George School. 
 We will miss them both dearly and Christine and Bettie are planning on MANY random checks to make sure 
they are both being taken care of very well.
</P>
<P>
We are pleased to announce that Eric Kodish aboard his Paint Gelding <em>Waterford</em> took a second place 
with a 62% in the Training Level Test 4 at the Los Alamos Dressage Center Show, run by Dr. Gail Carmona.

<b>Aug 27:</b>  Congratulations to Carly Meyers aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> on her Reserve Champion in the Lead Line division.  Lead by Dana LoGalbo, Carly had a fantastic second show, and we needed an extra bucket to haul away all the ribbons!
</P>  
<P>
Congratulations also go out to Denise Nosko, aboard <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em>, and Bridgette Wasco, riding 
<em>Miss Giggles</em>, in kicking butt in the Starter Rider Division.  
This was the first show for both of these young ladies and Christine is very proud to report 
that both did extremely well for their first time out, placing in every class they entered into!
</P>  
<P>
Kelley Scott, also riding <em>Apollo</em>, enjoyed her first show with a fantastic second class.  
Both Brooke and Christine agreed they had NEVER seen Kelley ride as beautifully as she did! 
(The webmaster would like to add, "Yay me!")
</P>
<P>
<em>Luke</em>, ridden by instructor Brooke Rossi for his VERY first show, took a sixth place in the Baby Green Division 
with a Honorable Recognition in the Baby Green U/S class.  This was a  fantastic day for Lukey and we are all 
very proud of his performance seeing as how it was his first time ever being ridden in the show ring with other horses.  
With a little more experience under his belt he will come along just fine.
</P>
<P>
