<P><b>Nov 17:</b>
With three horses and three riders in "tow" and facing very tough competition,  we 
once again had a great day at the first Duncraven Show of the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the day, Ashley Maelson rode <em>Miss Giggles</em> to a fourth in her Mini-Stirrup Equitation 
and a sixth in her Mini-Stirrup Pleasure class.  
Great job Ashley!  
Following that performance, Lena Feingold rode <em>Thelwell</em> to a sixth place in her 
Short Stirrup Equitation class over fences!  Awesome!  Last but not least, 
Jenn Carlino rode <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em> to a second and a fourth in her Beginner Rider Under Saddle classes.
</P>
<P>This was a tremendous showing with great results and huge classes!  
Special thanks go out to Dan Feingold, the Maelson family, Liz Abraham, and Dee Boehm on a great support and grooming team.  
Way to go girls!!!!
</P>
<P><b>Oct 20:</b>  
Congratulations go out to Hannah Young aboard Wildflowers' <em>Thelwell</em> and Ashley Maelson 
(Head Groom) aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> on their great performances in
the 
Mini-Stirrup Pleasure class on Sunday at the DVHA show.  The girls earned a 
fifth and a sixth!  This was Ashley's first show competing and both girls 
looked and did great in a huge class of competitors.  Congratulations also 
go out to Lena Feingold who as usual, brought home too many ribbons to count 
but wound up earning herself the 2003 DVHA Reserve Champion in Short Stirrup 
Hunter with <em>Thelwell</em>.  Great job team!  
</P>
<P>Special thanks also go out to our grooms the Lizes and  Cassidy Bulk as well as the Young-Shea family, 
the Feingold family and the Maelson family.  Great job guys!  
We were sorry that Jenn Carlino was not able to join us, she was scheduled to, but <em>Apollo</em> 
had a little tummy ache and had to stay home.  
We are happy to report that both Jenn and <em>Apollo</em> are doing great and getting jazzed up to 
start the Itty Bitty Jumpers soon!  Way to go team!!!
</P>
<P><b>Oct 13:</b>
Let's go Wildflowers!!!!!  Let's go Wildflowers!!!!!  While people back home 
didn't believe that it was actually 50 degrees and pouring rain on Sunday, 
Team Wildflowers went out and KICKED TAIL!!!  Congratulations go out to 
Carly Meyers and Cassidy Bulk, both riding <em>Miss Giggles</em> in the Mini Stirrup Section A and B Divisions, 
with a third and a fourth in the Mini Stirrup 
Pleasure Class.  Followed by BOTH girls earning their first third and fourth 
in the FIGURE EIGHT class!  Way to go! <em>Miss Giggles</em> was SPARKILNG, GLEAMING white and 
could not have looked more beautiful!  Congratulations girls!  
</P>
<P>
Gail Strecker earned two firsts and a third place in the 
Pre-Children's Hunter Division over fences.  She did have to cut the day 
short after Bliss had a little tummy upset.  Later in the afternoon, after 
the rain cleared, Cassidy Bulk earned the "Six Flags Great Adventure Zoo 
Keeper Award" in the CJHA 2003 Annual Halloween Costume class!!  There were 
some great costumes but no one could top <em>Miss Giggles</em> with her 
REAL Black Zebra stripes and Cassidy's khaki outfit!!! 
</p>
<p>
It is 
with great pride that we report that Carly and Cassidy have both earned 
year-end awards in the Mini-Stirrup Division and that Gail Strecker aboard 
her gelding Perpetual Bliss have earned a Grand Champion for the year in 
Pre-Children's Hunter!  Please come join us at the CJHA awards banquet on 
November 21st and cheer these riders on!  Way to go team!!!
</p>
<p>Special thanks 
go out to the Meyers Family, Sue Bulk, Liz Endres, Hannah Young and none 
other than the famous groom, Ashley Maelson for a fantastic grooming and 
cheering job!  Christine would also like to send out a special thank you to 
her in-laws for their tremendous support and understanding in leaving the 
annual Harvestfest early, so that she could go coach.

<P><b>Aug 8:</b>
After a late decision Saturday night, by everyone involved, the entire Team 
Wildflowers decided to head over to the CJHA show so that everyone could be 
together.  It was a great experience!  Keith Meyers, towing a horse 
trailer for the first time, took <em>Miss Giggles</em>, <em>Thelwell</em>, and <em>Perpetual Bliss</em>, while 
Brooke Rossi took <em>Renie's Beau Ace</em>, and <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em> in the smaller 
trailer.  Kicking the day off, Carly Meyers took a 4th in a class of over 15 
young riders in the Mini-Stirrup Section A division aboard Wildflowers's 
Miss Giggles.  Following that, at her CJHA show debut, Hannah Young 
earned a first place (HER FIRST BLUE RIBBON!) in the Mini-Stirrup Section B 
Division.  Later Gail Strecker, aboard her gelding <em>Perpetual 
Bliss</em>, competed in the Pre-Children's Hunter and Equitation Divisions where 
she earned herself a first, a third, three fifths and a sixth!  Sarah 
Rockoff also had her CJHA debut aboard her leased gelding, <em>Renie's 
Beau Ace</em> and earned herself a second place in a gigantic class in the 
Beginner Hunter Division.  Sarah later fell off in the ring when a HUGE 
storm came in and spooked ALL of the horses outside the ring (about 30 of 
them) but we are happy to report that Sarah quickly got up and wiped the mud 
off of her face -- revealing a big smile!  She did great!!!  Kristin Bitter, 
competing in another very large class, earned four straight third places in 
the Maiden Equitation Division.  Great job Kristin!  Congratulations to all 
of our competitors and horses, Brooke and Christine were thrilled with 
everyone's performance.
</P>
<P>Special thanks also go out to the Meyers family, the Moses-Rappeport 
Family, the Bulk family, the Yound-Shea family and none other than the 
legendary groom, Ashley "Groom 'Em Till They Shine" Maelson.  Super special 
thanks also go out to Jeff for sticking out the entire day with the team!  
(We can't wait to get our hands on that new truck!)  Brooke would also like 
to take this opportunity to mention to all of our clients that she would 
like to learn to speak Italian, if anyone is available for tutoring, please 
see Brooke!<br>
GREAT JOB TEAM!!!  GO.........W-I-L-D-F-L-O-W-E-R-S!!!
</P>

<P>
<b>July 27:</b>  Rumor has it Christine passed her side saddle test, 
with a top score in her Candidate Presentation!  Congrats!!
</P>
<P>
<b>July 2:</b>
Jacks FOUND!!!  A very heart felt thank you goes out to Carolyn and Gail 
Strecker (AKA Bliss' Mom & Sister/Rider) for taking it upon themselves to 
take Miss Jingles (MJ) and Savannah home with them for the evening after they had  "mysteriously" escaped from the pen.  
Christine and Brooke spent the 
early morning hours of Tuesday driving round looking for the two Jack 
Russells and were ESTACTIC to hear from Carolyn that Savannah and MJ were safe and sound.  Brooke and Christine are forever 
indebited to them for their help.  "It is the reason why I love my job 
so much," says Christine, "I get to work with the best people that love 
their animals, my animals, and are always willing to lend a helping hand 
when we are in a pinch.  I am so thankful for Carolyn and Gail."  According 
to Miss Jingles and Savannah, the Strecker's home was very nice but they were 
not allowed to sleep in bed with them as they are normally allowed to do at 
their homes.  (Spoiled JRTs!!!)

<P>
<b>June 29:</b> Sunday found Team Wildflowers at DVHA bright and early, 
alone and actually a bit concerned that maybe the show had been canceled!  
But, soon more trailers started arriving, and Hannah Young and Sarah Rockoff, 
the two horses, and our trusty A number one groom, Ashley Maelson, got ready to kick rump!  
We are VERY proud to report that in a tough 
class, in the Mini-Stirrup Equitation division, Hannah Young (Kim Leach's 
student) earned a fourth and a second aboard Wildflower's <em>Thelwell</em>!  
(The second was earned on her MUCH IMPROVED figure 8!  Yeah Hannah!)  
Then, following that, Hannah entered the Mini-Stirrup Hunter class where <em>Thelwell</em> earned a third place!  
But the real excitement was yet to come....  
</P>
<P>
While Sarah was mentioning to Christine that it appeared that <em>Renie's Beau Ace</em> (AKA Ace) had 
just loosened his shoe, <em>Thelwell</em> began acting funny in the middle of the 
line up before being called to do his next figure eight.  Just then...  <emThelwell</em> decided that 
it was a little hot and sunny and the bugs were bothering him and he 
layed down and tried to roll while Hannah, the great rider that she is, quickly jumped off to safety!  
Christine, Hannah, and <em>Thelwell</em> then excused themselves from the ring.  
But, there was quite a bit of excitement over Hannah's "trick riding".  
Then, while waiting to untack <em>Thelwell</em> it became apparent that <em>Ace</em>'s shoe was a 
more than just a "little loose".  Sarah actually pulled the shoe off 
herself and then everyone headed home.  A disappointing show for Sarah as she and <em>Ace</em> 
were really ready to kick, but we are happy to report that no riders, trainers, or horses were injured, 
and Hannah pulled in more ribbons at ONLY her SECOND show EVER!!!  
And <em>Ace</em> enjoyed two great trailer rides!  
Thanks again to Ashley Maelson and Mary Shea for helping out tremenedously for the morning.  We were, in fact, home for brunch.  (A nice change from 7PM)  Next up....  DVHA jumpers!!!  GO TEAM!!!
</P>

<P>
<b>June 22:</b>
The Annual Barn Barbeque, this year a Hawaiian Luau, was a "hoot"!  Leis, 
grass skirts, hula dancing and pineapples ruled the riding ring!  We had a 
great turn-out for this ever popular event and are already planning for next 
year!  The Rock Collecting Contest was won by Drew and the combined total 
weight of the rocks collected by all entrants was over 300 pounds!  No more 
hitting those big stones in our riding lessons!  A special thank you to all 
of the parents and students who helped make the rock collecting contest such 
a success.  Brooke's limbo contest was also a big hit, with four different 
winners each recieving a gift certificate to "Lick-It" in Princeton 
Junction.  A special thank you goes to the VERY flexible, Keith Meyers for 
leading our limbo kids around and getting them under that limbo stick!
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening we celebrated Kim and Brooke's birthdays with cake and 
even sherbert.  There was a ton of great food brought to the luau; Christine 
would like to request that if you brought something to the luau,  please get her the recipe -- it would be a big help!  
(Many parents 
have been asking, who made that?  What was in it?)  Christine will hopefully 
soon have a little mini-cookbook of all of those yummy recipes for anyone 
that is interested in getting one, just ask!  The next party event is for our 
adult riders... Keep your eyes open for the Wine & Cheese Party!  Thank you 
again to everyone that made the Luau such a fun time!
</P>


<P>
<b>June 1:</b>
Dad or Man in My Life Day at Wildflowers Farm was a huge and yummy success!  
Dad's and significant others as well as a mom or two joined us for coffee, 
donuts and horse-y fun.  Thank you to everyone who joined us and had fun.
</P>
<P>
Remember, Kelley Scott and Brooke Rossi are in charge of Children's Games at 
this year's 50th June Fete to benefit the Breast Health Center at the 
Medical Center at Princeton (remember too that Bettie's is one of the head honchos!) We 
are still need of help for the day of the Fete in Children's Games.  nNy 
student, family member, or friend who is available to volunteer or come to 
the Fete, PLEASE come to celebrate this great cause!  Any student who is 
available but who hasn't signed up...BE PREPARED TO RIDE WITH OUT STIRRUPS 
FOR A LONG TIME!!!  Seriously, please sign up and have a great time with all 
of us!!!
</P>


<P>
<b>May 25:</b>  Wet, wet, wet -- the only word to really describe Sunday's DVHA show in Ringoes. 
The morning started off, well... wet! while Sarah Rockoff rode her leased horse, 
<em>Renie's Beau Ace</em> to win fourth in the Begnner Hunter Rider Class in a 
GIGANTIC class of 16 other ninnies spending Sunday in the 
pouring rain! Following this, 
Kelley Scott, aboard Wildflowers' <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em> earned a third in the Walk Trot Pleasure Class in another HUGE
class! Soon after Hannah Young, debuting in her first real horse show ever,
earned a fourth in the Mini-Stirrup division riding none other than
Wildflowers' <em>Thelwell</em>. After a good bit of mud built up, Jenn Carlino in her own debut show, 
earned 2 seconds and a fourth riding <em>Apollo</em> in the Starter Rider Division. 
Then it was Lena Feingold's turn to show the judge her stuff in the Short Stirrup Equitation Division, 
where she earned herself 1 second and 3 third places. 
</P>
<P>
After a very, very long and drenched wait, Kristin Bitter went into the Howell Medal 
Memorial Class where she earned a well deserved 3rd after having a PHENOMINAL 
round over fences and then a challenging equitation test asked for by the judge. 
Unfortunately Kristin was not able to compete in her scheduled
Pre-Children's Equitation Class (AFTER IT STOPPED RAINING!) as Mr. Apollo
had a bit of a belly ache from the foul weather. He is doing better though
and he is on a strict tummy diet. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of thank yous need to go out to the
Feingold family, the Rockoff Family, the Scott-Olivier Family, the
Young-Shea family, the Maelson family, the Carlino family, the Bitter
family, the Meyers family, Jessica Naimark, Alex Nelson and none other than
Christine's very own husband, Jeff for sticking out the day with all of us,
bearing through the weather and holding horses, making food runs, and
working their tails off. Great job again, guys!!! GO TEAM!!!
</P>

<P>
<b>May 18:</b> CJHA was another big hit for Team Wildflowers!  With an 
early start from the farm, Carly Meyers kicked off the day at East Freehold 
Park riding <em>Miss Giggles</em> in the Mini-Stirrup Section A division.  
Carly brought home her first blue ribbon and trophy from a non-Leadline class, 
as well as a 5th and a 6th in a class of over 12 riders.  This was Carly's 
first time jumping at a show and it was nothing less than shocking!  Cassidy 
Bulk continued the great fortune aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> in the Section B 
Division earning two 5th place ribbons in a HUGE class that actually had to 
be divided!  Way to go ladies (Miss Giggles included!)!!!
</P>
<P>Later, at her 2003 debut show, Gail Strecker aboard her gelding, 
<em>Perpetual Bliss</em>, tried her hand at the Pre-Children's Equitation and 
Pre-Children's Hunter divisions.  Gail brought home a ribbon from each class 
including, a first, two seconds, three thirds, a fourth and a fifth.  Way to 
go Gail - after a long winter's nap, Gail and Bliss are BACK, WATCH OUT!!!
</P>
<P>Last but not least, Krissi Ressler, aboard Wildflowers' <em>Phantom Luke</em>, 
entered the Beginner Hunter Rider and Beginner Hunter Horse divisions.  
Krissi and <em>Luke</em> brought home two seconds, two thirds, and a fifth!  Great job guys!  
Special thanks goes out to Ashley Maelson, Christina Dunne, Sue Bulk, Keith Meyers, Sarah Bulk, 
and Brooke Rossi for all of their great support, cheering and grooming.
</P>

<P><b>May 17:</b> The Children's Games crew was hard at work at the farm, painting and sprucing up things, 
getting set for the 50th June Fete.  
Thanks to Megan McGovern, Denise Nosko, and Jeanne Olivier for all their artistic talents.  
If you have not signed up to help out at the Fete on June 7th, please do so, the sign-up sheet is on the corkboard.  
We also have great Fete signs that are desperately seeking lawns on well-traveled streets.  
If you have one of these lawns please help Bettie out!
</P>

<P><b>May 10:</b>  It is with great regret that Christine must once again deliver somber news.  
After a very long evening of trying to diagnose and battle a sudden illness 
affecting <em>ONEOFTHOSELADIES </em> (Piggie), Christine made the very difficult decision to have <em>Piggie</em> put down.  
She will be greatly missed by everyone, especially her best friend, Krissi Ressler.  
Krissi and <em>Piggie</em> had been working together for over 2 years and had improved 
dramatically and competed successfully in Dressage.  
Christine asks everyone to please keep Krissi in your thoughts and prayers.  
Special thanks goes out to Kim Leach, Brooke Rossi, Dr. Daniel P. Keenan, and 
Krissi's friend Matt who walked, hugged and comforted <em>Piggie</em> until the end.  
She is now running around and doing piaffe in greener pastures.
</P>

<P><b>May 4:</b>  Sunday morning started off a bit rough.  
We regret to inform all of our friends that Rose, one of our barn kitties, 
was killed by a car early Sunday morning on Cranbury Road.  
We will miss her greatly and thank everyone for their very sweet thoughts and prayers.
</P>
<P>
Mom/Lady in my Life Day was a big hit out at the farm.  Thank you to 
all of our clients, family, and friends for coming out and joining us.  We 
ate, we played with the horses and walked and gator'ed the property.  Dads, 
don't feel left out, your day is coming next month!!!
</P>
<P>
Congratulations go out to our instructor, Brooke Rossi, and her 5-year old 
mare, <em>Dancer</em>.  The two of them successfully competed at the Monmouth County Horse Show in 
the Itty Bitty division.  Brooke and <em>Dancer</em> earned themselves a 2nd and a 4th 
in a large class of strong competitors.  Special thanks also goes out to Sue and Cassidy 
Bulk, Krissi Ressler, Bettie Greber, and Christine Calandra for coming out to cheer and groom.  
We'd also like to note that <em>Sunny</em> had her first trip off of the farm 
and SLEPT next to the ring for the day.  We got many compliments on how well-mannered and cute she was.  
BUT we already knew that, didn't we?!
</P>

<P><b>Apr 27:</b>  Up with the chickens, Team Wildflowers was off to the
first DVHA Hunter Show of the Season with two trailers, 4 horses, 5 students and 2 grooms.  
I believe there was also a small dog...
</P>
<P>
Sarah Rockoff and <em>Ace</em> kicked off the morning with a 5th and 6th place 
in Beginner Rider and Beginner Hunter. Great job for their FIRST SHOW 
(and for Ace, his first TRAILER RIDE AND OFF PROPERTY EXPEREINCE EVER)!
</P>
<P>
Kelley Scott and <em>Apollo</em> (AKA Sharkey), rode well in the Walk Trot division winning an 
3rd place in both Equitation and Pleasure. Her third show, it appears Kelley is getting into the all 
important show groove that many students work very hard for many years to achieve. Congratulations!
</P>
<P>
Lena Feingold then competed on <em>Thelwell</em> in the Short Stirrup Equitation and Hunter divisions, 
taking home several ribbons, 
including a 1st and 2nd place. YEAH!  Kristin Bitter, also riding <em>Sharkey</em> 
then kicked off her series with a very impressive 2nd in the Welling C. Howell Memorial Medal Class, 
and followed that success with
3rd, 4th, and a 5th in Pre-Children's Equitation. 
</P>
<P>
Then for the grand finale! After a very long wait, Carolyn Hurlburt riding Bettie Greber's 
<em>Silver Dollar Bet</em> in his first show ever earned a 5th in the Baby Green Hunter Division. 
Congrats to horse and rider!
</P>
<P>
Thirteen hours and 15 total ribbons later, Team Wildflowers was back home and all tired horses were tucked in. 
Congratulations to all of our riders -- it is important to note that the show was packed on Sunday and all 
competitors were in large classes!
</P>
<P>
Special thanks to Gay Bitter, the Feingold family, Cassidy Bulk, and Hannah
Shea for all their help and support. SHowing would not be possible without
these grooms and cheerleaders! Also, a very special thank you to Bettie
Greber for driving the second trailer and helping out ALL DAY LONG! We came,
we showed, we kicked equine butt! GO TEAM!!!
</P>

show of the season.  Congratulations go out to Carly Meyers and Cassidy Bulk, both riding <em>Miss Giggles</em>, Nicole 
Powell (at her first horse show ever!!!) riding <em>Thelwell</em> and Krissi Ressler riding <em>Luke</em>.

The small group of students and Christine had a super time learning new things from some of the 
greatest horse people in the country.  They also shopped for a while and found many, many, Christmas Wish List items.  
Next year we definitely need a bigger group!!!
</P>

<P><b>Feb 10:</b> Sunday's Braiding Clinic was a big success!  
Krissi Resslar took up the reins on a moment's notice after learning the scheduled instructor,

ALL of the attending students did a wonderful job of braiding. (By now they realize it's a whole lot harder than it seemed!)  
We hope to see many students practicing and putting this new skill to work for the Spring shows!  Well done!

A special thank you to Sue Bulk, Krissi Ressler, and the Boschitsch family for all their help today. 
We did not have our usual barn staff and these people were kind enough to help Christine out as she 
hobbles about in a walking cast.her According to Christine, "Having great people that you can call in a 
pinch is a great aspect to my business.  Thank you very much for your help."  
If any students are interested in being put on the emergency barn help list, 
please call or email Christine and we'll add you!
</P>

<P><b>Feb 6:</b>  Congratulations are due to Christine, who has just been certified by 
ARIA as a Level II Instructor in Open Jumpers. Here at the farm we're all so proud of her -- 
she's now one of only two instructors in New Jersey to have Level II certification in both 
Hunt Seat Equitation and Open Jumpers! Hip hip hurrah!
</P>

<P><b>Jan 15:</b>  It's coooooold out there -- the horses at Wildflowers Farm asked the webmaster to 
remind students to button up as they are NOT sharing those plaid blankets!  
Remember - no lessons if the temperature or wind chill factor dips below 17 degrees.
