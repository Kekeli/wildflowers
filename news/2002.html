<P><b>Dec 30:</b>
We would like to wish everyone a very happy holiday and a safe, happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year.
</P>

<P>
Congratulations to Karin Naimark and her daughter Jessica on having their photo of their horse, <em>Charlie</em>, 
on the cover of the Breyer 2002 Just About Horses Magazine.  He makes quite a handsome cover model!
</P>
<P> 
NOTE: any student wishing to take part in the instructional video making must have their proposal submitted
 to Christine by January 4th. Please remember to check the message board at the farm for important messages!
</P>

<P><b>Dec 9:</b>
A big "Thank you!" to everyone who was able to attend the 3rd annual Wildflowers Farm Holiday Party.  
We had a great attendance (108 people!) at First Wok in West Windsor.  
The food was great, the conversation was excellent and a good time was had by all.  Next up: the July Barbecue!
</P>

<P><b>Dec 1:</b> Hats off (or rather helmets on and tight) to Brooke Rossi, 
aboard her 4-year old Thoroughbred mare, <em>Dancer</em>, and Gail Strecker aboard her 5-year old Thoroughbred gelding, <em>Perpetual Bliss</em>, on a successful first Foxhunt outing.  Gail and Brooke were invited to go foxhunting with judge and friend, Merri Musso.  They went out on Black Friday and returned invigorated and ready for the next hunt on Friday afternoon.  We are pleased to report that both ladies had a fantastic time, were well-behaved (one must be rather proper on the hunt) and were invited to go again sometime soon!  
Now, they are trying to convince Christine to go!  
Ha ha!  Great job ladies and horses!  Tally-ho!
</P>

<P><b>Nov 14:</b> A very happy birthday to Christine!!
</P>

<P><b>Nov 12:</b> After a long trip, beginning in Oklahoma and winding through 8 states, 
Bettie's new horse <em>Silver Dollar Bet</em> arrived at the farm early Sunday morning.  
The latest addition to the Wildflowers string is a BEAUTIFUL gray 16.2h, 6-year old Trakehner Thoroughbred cross.  
He has his walk trot canter down pat and does a sweet 4-foot course.  
Silver will be used with our students of all ages, although Christine is really dying to get on him first!  
(The line to ride him forms at the rear.)  Congratulations to Bettie!
</P>
<P> Later on Sunday <em>Phantom Luke</em> (aka Lukey) took home a fifth and a sixth at the Meadow 
Show in the Beginner Hunter and Low Green Hunter classes.  
He was perfectly well mannered the entire day and with Brooke Rossi showing him off, he looked amazing.  
Congratulations to Brooke and Lukey!
</P>

<P><b>Oct 28:</b>  Congratulations to Kim Leach and his students Krissi Ressler and Eric Kodish on a tremendous showing, 
including a first in class for Kim and a sixth in Training Level for Krissi, 
at the Championships for Dressage at the Horse Park of New Jersey.  
All riders did wonderfully throughout the Dressage season -- we're so pleased with their success.
</P> 
<P> 
Congratulations also go out to Cassidy Bulk, aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> on her fourth- 
and fifth-place wins in the Mini-Stirrup Division at the Hunter Farms show.  
Cheers to Carolyn Hurlburt, riding <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em>.  
In their first show ever in the Junior Beginner Equitation Division, Carolyn earned an honorable mention in the Walk Trot class.  Both girls had very stiff competition and huge class sizes with over 15 riders in both divisions. Thank you to our grooms Sarah Rockoff, Gail Strecker, Jenn Carlino, Kelly Eiker, and Cassidy's cousin Allie on a superior job and LOUD show of support!
</P>

<P>
<b>Oct 21:</b> First things, first -- a very happy birthday to Krissi!!!
</P>
<P> Second, we are thrilled to report that Wildflowers Farm is home to the American Riding Instructors Association (ARIA) Lesson Horse of the Year!!!  Facing the usual stiff competition, <em>Gaiya</em> tied with another horse for the top honors!  Through her spokeswoman, <em>Gaiya</em> requests that the celebratory sugar cubes be sent care of the farm, 315 Cranbury Road, ....
</P>
<P>
<b>Oct 20:</b>  Congratulations to Michaela Raglione on her outstanding effort and success at DVHA in the Lead-line Division!!  With Dana LoGalbo on the one end of the leadline, and Wildflowers Farm's <em>Miss Giggles</em> on the business end, Michaela won two third-place ribbons, and a fourth, and a sixth place -- all after a lengthy delay.  Way to go!
</P>
<P> Kelley Scott, the webmaster, set down the computer keyboard long enough to put on her helmet, dress boots, and coat, and have a wonderful time in the Walk Trot Division.  With a great deal of assistance from the Farm's <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em>, Kelley won a sixth place in the Pleasure class.  Asked for comment later, she was heard to say something along the lines of "What a hoot!".
</P>
<P>Our thanks go to the support team, including groom Lena Feingold, Dana LoGalbo and Gail Strecker, and the parental units Bettie and Pat Greber, for all their help and good cheer.
</P>
<P>
<b>Oct 13:</b>  On short notice Christine learned that CJHA was cancelled today, so the trailer made a U-turn and the hunter show team headed to the Woodedge Stables.  There Gail Strecker, aboard her gelding <em>Perpetual Bliss</em> took a second, two thirds, and a fourth in their first ever "A" rated show!  Special thanks go to Carolyn Hurlburt who did an exceptional job grooming for her first time.  We are pleased to note that Gail also won CJHA year-end awards with a Grand Champion in Hunter Horse and a Reserve Champion in Hunter Rider.
</P>
<P>
Congratulations also go to Kim's students, Eric Kodish and Krissi Ressler, who both did an excellent job in their dressage show.  Eric, aboard his gelding <em>Waterford</em>, and Krissi, aboard Wildflowers Farm's <em>Oneofthoseladies</em>, earned a 62.8% and a 62.4% respectively on their Training Level tests.  Great job team, especially since it was Krissi's FIRST SHOW EVER!
</P>
<P> 
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Goodzeit family and their horse <em>Lucy</em>, who is currently undergoing treatment for a serious eye injury at the New Bolton Center.

<b>Sept 30:</b>  Congratulations go to Dana LoGalbo aboard <em>Marquis</em>, Denise Nosko aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> and Carly Meyers, also aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em>, on their fantastic day at the DVHA show.  Dana won her first two stakes classes and several ribbons in the Puddle Jumper and Itty Bitty classes as well. Carly Meyers earned three blue ribbons in the Lead Line Division (led by Dana LoGalbo), and Denise Nosko had two wonderful rounds in the Beginner Hunter and Beginner rider Walk Trot divisions. Special thanks to our grooms and show moms!  Great job!
</P>
<P>
<b>Sept 29:</b>  Yesterday Wildflowers Farm held its first ever Mini-Show and Clinic, and we owe a special thank you to Judge Merri Musso for her excellent lecture and judging.  Her fun-loving attitude, along with her phenomenal knowledge of showing and horsemanship, were incredible additions to the lessons program at Wildflowers.</P>
<P> 
Congratulations to all of our riders that showed at the clinic.  Brooke, Christine, and Kim were all proud and impressed with the effort that all put forth to do their absolute best and to help the other students in their classes!  Merri herself was very impressed with the hard work that all the riders demonstrated and was especially pleased with the degree of support, great sportsmanship, and enthusiasm the competitors and their friends and families demonstrated!  Way to go team!
</P>
<P> 
A special thank you goes out to our Registrars, Tackers, and especially the best braider in the world, Krissi Ressler.  Krissi spent hours prepping all of the horses for this Mini-Show and Clinic and Judge Musso asked to personally meet her because all of the horses were so well turned out.  Remember Krissi is available for braiding with advanced notice! 
</P>
<P>
Please remember that our next Mini-Show and Clinic will be in January with Judge and Instructor Bob Allen of Woodedge Stables.  We look forward to seeing all of our students out at that show.
</P>


<P>
<b>Sept 16:</b> Hats off to Gail Strecker and <em>Perpetual Bliss</em> on two fronts: with dozens of riders vying for a handful of spots, Gail and Bliss made the George School's Varsity Equestrian Team!  In addition, Gail won Grand Champion in the Hunter Horse Division and Reserve Champion in the Hunter Rider Division at yesterday's CJHA show in East Freehold.
</P>
<P> We are also very pleased to report that Kimball Leach, aboard one of his client's horses, <em>Andy</em>, scored a 66% on his Level II test 4 Dressage test.  Congratulations to both Kim and Gail!!
</P>

<P>
<b>Sept 1:</b> The August Camp for 9- to 16-year olds was a huge success.  
The students' riding dramatically improved over the six riding lessons and their barn skills were top notched.  
They had daily seminars with Dave Witkins, the farrier, Sue Bulk, the equine massage therapist, 
and Dr. Rachael Schuster of Dr. Keenan and Associates.  Camp activities included riding, caring for the horses, 
tending to the barn, seminars, lunch and snacks.  A great time was held by all and most campers decided they would 
like to "do this EVERYDAY!"  According to Christine...  THEY'RE CRAZY! 
 We look forward to our February Camp session over the President's Day Holiday and will be taking reservations 
for camp spots on a first-come, first-serve basis.
</P>

<P>
Spots for the September 28th Clinic with Judge Merri Musso are filling up fast.  
If you are interested in this clinic please see Christine or Bettie as soon as possible.
</P>
<P> 
Please remember to sign up for the Mandatory Show Meeting on September 22nd at Brother's Pizza in Princeton Junction 
(next to the fire house).  If you have any intention of showing this fall or winter you MUST come to this meeting, 
otherwise you will have to wait until April to begin showing.
</P>
<P> 
We would like to send our very best wishes to Gail Strecker and her gelding <em>Perpetual Bliss</em>.  
They will be leaving us for the school year to attend the George School. 
 We will miss them both dearly and Christine and Bettie are planning on MANY random checks to make sure 
they are both being taken care of very well.
</P>
<P>
We are pleased to announce that Eric Kodish aboard his Paint Gelding <em>Waterford</em> took a second place 
with a 62% in the Training Level Test 4 at the Los Alamos Dressage Center Show, run by Dr. Gail Carmona.   
Eric has also qualified to ride in the championships for year-end awards.  We wish him and Ford the very best of luck!
</P>


<P>
<b>Aug 27:</b>  Congratulations to Carly Meyers aboard <em>Miss Giggles</em> on her Reserve Champion in the Lead Line division.  Lead by Dana LoGalbo, Carly had a fantastic second show, and we needed an extra bucket to haul away all the ribbons!
</P>  
<P>
Congratulations also go out to Denise Nosko, aboard <em>Apollo 2 Houston</em>, and Bridgette Wasco, riding 
<em>Miss Giggles</em>, in kicking butt in the Starter Rider Division.  
This was the first show for both of these young ladies and Christine is very proud to report 
that both did extremely well for their first time out, placing in every class they entered into!
</P>  
<P>
Kelley Scott, also riding <em>Apollo</em>, enjoyed her first show with a fantastic second class.  
Both Brooke and Christine agreed they had NEVER seen Kelley ride as beautifully as she did! 
(The webmaster would like to add, "Yay me!")
</P>
<P>
<em>Luke</em>, ridden by instructor Brooke Rossi for his VERY first show, took a sixth place in the Baby Green Division 
with a Honorable Recognition in the Baby Green U/S class.  This was a  fantastic day for Lukey and we are all 
very proud of his performance seeing as how it was his first time ever being ridden in the show ring with other horses.  
With a little more experience under his belt he will come along just fine.
</P>
<P>
<b>Aug 14:</b>  More good news!  Our own Gaiya has been nominated for ARIA Schoolhorse of the Year, a nationwide honor!  
Results won't be known until October, but here at the farm we know she's a "shoe in".  Also, Magnum the Cat will once again be gracing us with his presence at the farm beginning August 20th!
</P>

<P>
<b>Aug 12:</b>  At the Handy Acres Dressage Show, Eric Kodish, riding <em>Waterford</em>, 
scored 66.538 percent and 66.400 percent in Training Tests 3 and 4, respectively.  
In addition, Krissi Ressler enjoyed an excellent schooling session with <em>Oneofthoseladies (Piggie)</em>.

in the Mini-Stirrup Pleasure class.
Congratulations to all our riders!
</P>
<P>
The first summer camp session was a great success.  Brooke was pleased to report that Jack and Hannah rode beautifully, 
and made great horse treats, horse collages, and horse statues.  The mini-rock collecting contest was a hit, too.  
The next camp, for students 9-16, is scheduled for August 19, 21, and 23.  There is one remaining spot available.  
Please contact Christine
to sign up.
</P>
<P>
Congratulations to the Naimark family on their purchase of Charlie's Chocolate.  
We wish them lots of years of fun and success with Charlie!
</P>

<P><b>July 2:</b> Over a 100 folks attended Friday's BBQ and picnic -- the rock collecting contest was a big hit, 
the Stitching Horse kindly donated "gate" prizes, and the food was great to boot!  
(p.s., if you haven't already, please pick up your spoons in the barn!)

We are happy to report that neither Dana nor <EM>Marquis</EM> were injured and that both are looking forward to the next CJHA show on June 16, 2002,
 as well as other shows beforehand. Great effort, Dana!
