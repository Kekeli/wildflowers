<h3>Riding</h3>
<h4><a name="#1">What style of riding is taught?</a></h4>
<p><SPAN CLASS="name">Wildflowers Farm</SPAN> offers instruction in hunt seat equitation, open jumpers, and dressage. 
We do not currently offer lessons in Western riding.

<h4><a name="#2">Are there trail rides or group rentals?</a></h4>
<p><SPAN CLASS="name">Wildflowers Farm</SPAN> does not offer group lessons or trail rides of any kind.

<h4><a name="#3">Are lessons private or shared?</a></h4>
<p>
All beginner students are placed into private lessons where they may 
master basic skills in a one-on-one setting.  However, once our students 
reach Level III in riding ability they are generally placed into a 
semi-private lesson with another student of similar ability, age and learning style.  

<p>
Semi-private lessons offer students an opportunity to observe another rider (and horse) in the ring, 
prepare to ride with multiple horses in an enclosed area, and even play games.  
For the safety of horses and riders, students will be placed into a semi-private lesson only when ready.  
Advanced students wishing to continue with private lessons may do so for an additional charge.
</P>


<h4><a name="#4">When can I ride?</a></h4>
<p>Riding lessons may be scheduled Tuesday through Saturday; coaching is also available at horse shows on Sundays. 
From September to June, lesson hours begin at 3 pm  for our school-age students.  
In addition, there are a limited number of spots available 8 am to 3 pm, Tuesdays through Thursdays, for adult students.

During the summer, we offer lessons both in the morning and in the late afternoon 
(the horses have a siesta during the midday sun).  
</P>


<h4><a name="#5">What equipment is needed?</a></h4>
<P>
We require all students to wear an ASTM-approved riding helmet and suitably heeled boots, and encourage a courteous, "can do!" attitude.  
Children as young as 4 years may begin lessons; all other ages and abilities are welcome!
</P>

<h4><a name="#6">What activities besides lessons are available?</a></h4>
<P> 
Throughout the year we also offer clients the opportunity to attend events 
that address different horse care and riding related issues.  In the past, for example, we have offered three-day summer camps, show clinics, 
and even a "Clothing Swap" for all of those old show clothes!

<P>Students may also
<ul>
<li>Ride on and around the farm during their lesson time
<li>Compete at Local through A-2 Level Shows
<li>Attend Hunter Paces and Paper Chases
<li>Try Equicize or foxhunting
</ul>


<h3>Students</h3>
<h4><a name="#8">At what age can I begin lessons?</a></h4>
<P>Children as young as 4 years of age may begin riding lessons at WF.  There is no height criteria, however the maximum weight
our horses can bear is 250 lbs.

<h4><a name="#9">I've had several 29th birthdays -- can I still learn to ride?</a></h4>
<p>
While the majority of our students are children/youth, roughly twenty percent of our clientele are over 
the age of 30.  Many of these students gave up 
riding as a child for various reasons and are now returning to the 
sport.  Just as many of our adult clients are beginners!    

<p>Reasons to begin riding include:
-Great exercise
-Preparing for a vacation or event featuring riding
-Learning something new
-Meeting new people
-Spending time with these majestic animals


<p>In addition to all of our regular services we also offer our adult clients:
<ul>
<li>Adult Riding Camps and Clinics
<li>In the Spring, morning rides with tea
<li>Wine and Cheese Parties throughout the year
</ul>

<h4><a name="#10">Are there tests? Grades?</a></h4>
<p>
We periodically evaluate students' progress.  We also ask our students to comment on our instruction.


<h3>Horses and Facilities</h3>
<h4><a name="#11">Are the horses friendly?</a></h4>

<p>In a word, yes. All the horses used in lessons are well-trained, and students will only ride horses suitable for their experience level.

<h4><a name="#12">What boarding is available?</a></h4>
<p>Our barn currently has a few large (12' by 12') stalls available for full board, which includes: 
two meals, daily turn-out, and a clean stall.  Our large, lush pastures with run-ins and automatic 
waterers offer your horse complete comfort during daily turn-outs.  

<P>
We provide quality care for all of our own horses, and extend this attention to our boarders as well.  
For nominal fees, we offer additional services (e.g., extra feed or vitamins, grooming, and wrapping).
To schedule a tour or to receive a boarding application, please contact us. 

<h4><a name="#13">What training is available?</a></h4>
<p>Horses boarded at <SPAN CLASS="name">Wildflowers Farm</SPAN> may be "enrolled" in training sessions; 
in these sessions, we focus on correcting specific problems encountered by the owner or on 
keeping the horse in good physical and mental condition when the owner is unable to ride on a consistent basis.  

<P>
Training sessions can be scheduled Tuesday through Saturday. 
When possible, we like the owners to be present to ensure that the same aids are being used by both trainer and owner.   
We also like to meet with the owners regularly to discuss helpful techniques and their horse's progress.

<h4><a name="#14">The weather is iffy - do I still ride?</a></h4>
<p>We have an indoor arena that can be used in inclement weather.  During the winter, lessons are cancelled if the effective temperature
drops below 20 degrees.  Excessive heat or lightning will also rule out lessons.
